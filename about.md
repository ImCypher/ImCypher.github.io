Hello, my name is Joseph Cook. I've been a software developer and IT professional since 2014.

I have been living and working in the northern Indiana area while being married to my amazing wife, Shannon.

My current skills include programming in C#, database management, and end user assistance.

I am currently working on this website by creating content and learning Python.
